CLI Job Runner for XenForo 2.2
==============================

This XenForo 2.2+ addon implements a CLI triggered job runner for use with Unix cron as a replacement for the built-in
`xf:run-jobs` command introduced in XF 2.2
 
New features include extensive logging and debugging support for jobs and cron tasks and the ability to run commands
for extended periods of up to 10 minutes.
