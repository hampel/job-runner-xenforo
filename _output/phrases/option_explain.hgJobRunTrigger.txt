Long-running and scheduled tasks are deferred to the job system. By default, activity on the forum triggers these jobs to run. This can be changed to trigger independently of forum activity but additional setup is required.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> If you select "Server based trigger" you are required to configure your server (such as with <code>crontab</code> or <code>cron.d</code>) manually to execute the following command once per minute: <code>php /path/to/xf/cmd.php xf:run-jobs</code>
